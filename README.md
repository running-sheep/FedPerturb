The [Appendix](./Appendix%20of%20%E2%80%9CFedPerturb%20Covert%20Poisoning%20Attack%20on%20Federated%20Learning%20via%20Partial%20Perturbation%E2%80%9D.pdf) is the results of the FedPerturb attack on several advanced defence schemes under different Non-iid conditions, and the experimental results show that our attack scheme FedPerturb still has good attack effect under Non-iid conditions.
